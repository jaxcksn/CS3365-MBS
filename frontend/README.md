# Frontend

The frontend is React (w/ Typescript) and is bundled is Vite which allows for fast, clean builds.

You'll probably want to run the backend at the same time as the front end.

## Getting Started

### Before Installing

You'll need NodeJS installed properly and in the command line.

### First Time Only

The first thing you'll need to do is run the following command in the root of the directory:

`npm install`

### Running the Dev Server

After all the packages are done installing (which may take awhile) you can then run the following to start the local dev server:

`npm run dev`

This will let you view the frontend in your browser. Vite should output a URL that you can click like so:

```
  VITE v5.4.8  ready in 108 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```
